This repository contains all coursework, assignments, and projects completed as part of ISYE 6644: Simulation, a core course in the Master of Science in Analytics program at Georgia Tech.

The course focuses on modeling and analyzing complex stochastic systems using simulation techniques. Topics include discrete-event simulation, Monte Carlo methods, random number generation, system modeling, variance reduction techniques, and simulation optimization, with an emphasis on applying simulation to support data-driven decision-making in real-world operational contexts.
